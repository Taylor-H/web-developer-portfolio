### Monument Blog

Congratulations, you have been hired to build your first webpage!

Luckly your designer team as already provided you with Mockups to what the webpage should look like. For this lab:

- Create a New folder called `monument_blog` and have it on the same level as our `FEWD-BOS-37`
- Copy the `index.html`, `css/`, and `images/` folders to this new folder
- You will be using this for several labs in the coming classes
- Work to align the webpage to match the `styleguide_basic.png`
- If you finish that, work to align the webpage with either the medium or advanced designs!
